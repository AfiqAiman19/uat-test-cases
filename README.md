# UAT Test Cases Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of User Acceptance Testing (UAT) test cases that demonstrate my experience in software testing, test case design, and validation of business requirements.

The test cases are documented in a structured format covering different functional scenarios such as pricing calculations, loyalty redemption logic, and consistency between different ordering flows.
